# Capital-One---Model-Building-on-a-Synthetic-Dataset
Capital One take home assignment 

The two synthetic datasets were generated using the same underlying data model. Your goal is to build a predictive model using the data in the training dataset to predict the withheld target values from the test set.

You may use any tools available to you for this task. Ultimately, we will assess predictive accuracy on the test set using the mean squared error metric. You should produce the following:

A 1,000 x 1 text file containing 1 prediction per line for each record in the test dataset.
A brief writeup describing the techniques you used to generate the predictions. Details such as important features and your estimates of predictive performance are helpful here, though not strictly necessary.
(Optional) An implementable version of your model. What this would look like largely depends on the methods you used, but could include things like source code, a pickled Python object, a PMML file, etc. Please do not include any compiled executables.

The project aims to complete the above task.
